# Fitness-App
This project shows the detailed development of the software for a fitness app. From the time programming of the project to creating the use cases, robustness diagrams, sequence diagrams and writing the java code.
It is a project completed by me and a group of fellow students during the 8th semester of our studies as part of the Software Technology course. Therefore the reports will be in greek.
